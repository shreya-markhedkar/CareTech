# CareTech
ABSTRACT Our smart watch enables the children and caretakers to monitor the health of the elderly. We provide a solution to bridge the communication gap between them and take fast action during emergencies. This will be convenient for use by old people. It will be very useful for people with amnesia or dementia. We are using components like NodeMCU esp32, MAX30100 pulse Oximeter and MPU6050 to execute our idea. We believe that our innovation may prove to be very life-changing.
